1) need to provid method to get patient claims based on patient address
   To use in table of  patietn.html 
2) In add claim page , what if claimId is repeated ? Is it (claimid) should be unique ?


3) Is it not good to move "ClaimCreated" event from app.js to corresponding html page i.e central.html 

4) clear the claim data ofter new claim creation 

5) bala: we are not able to see very details abt errr in error callback . 
scenario we tested is 'providing not existing approved caleimid' for approveClaim()

Error while approving a claim details at 
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x118ca5f8bd026f584d12e560829d473acf4a97c962c433b7cd81e6321e5f5e32
but it has excuted  success calback instead of error


"Error: gas required exceeds allowance or always failing transaction at chrome-"

6) refresh the grid after patient claim status changes - this won't require because network will takes time to approve the claim.

7) clear claim form after claim creation 

8) web3 js send multiple api calls at time.

9) On central page on clicking claim id details need to show - done

------10) if max claim ammount exceeds addclaim should not allow. but, currently its allowing.
